# Chess

This is a simple chess game written in PyQt6 (originally PyQt5) for Software Engineering class in ITU.
It was combination off [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) and [shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi) games before, but I've removed shogi part because I don't like it a
lot.

You can play against a friend on a local computer.
